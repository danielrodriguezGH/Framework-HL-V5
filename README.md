# Framework HL-V5 (High-Level Logic)

The **HL-V5** is a high-precision recursive architecture designed to stabilize inference and mitigate logical entropy in Large Language Models. 

## 🚀 Quick Access
* **[Technical Specifications](./technical-specs.md)** - Full architectural breakdown (Nodes 01-05).
* **[Formal Abstract](./abstract.md)** - Summary of the ontological stabilization protocols.

## 🛠 Core Methodology
Unlike standard prompting, HL-V5 utilizes:
1. **Dynamic Latent Tuning** to synchronize intent.
2. **Isomorphic Feedback Loops** to maintain context.
3. **High-Order Synthesis** for emergent determinism.
