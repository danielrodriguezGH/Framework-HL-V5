# HL-5V Framework: Technical Abstract

## 1. Executive Summary
The **Framework-HL-V5** represents a paradigm shift in Large Language Model (LLM) interaction. Developed over a 60-day calibration cycle, this methodology establishes a **Persistent Ontological Mesh**. By deploying a five-node recursive architecture, the framework mitigates logical entropy, maintaining a stable processing rigor of $10^{-15}$.

## 2. The Five Pillars (Sincrodia Protocol)
* **V1 - Axiomatic Rigor:** Systematic audit of foundational logic.
* **V2 - Recurrent Alignment:** Real-time synchronization of model intent.
* **V3 - High-Order Synthesis:** Emergent determinism.
* **V4 - Expert Supervision:** Human-in-the-loop optimization.
* **V5 - Persistence Mesh:** Immutable state tracking.

## 4. Scope
The **HL-V5** is in its **Production-Ready** phase, designed for high-stakes environments where logical coherence is non-negotiable.
